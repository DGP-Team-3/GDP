    harmless fun.
  - Hey, you know how you can train dogs to learn commands? Do you think you could
    train a cat like that, too?
  - We can learn a lot from those who are always asking questions of the world.

    them.
  - I just LOVE cuddling my cats!! But not all cats love to cuddle back, ahaha.
  - "To be honest, I'm a little scared of cats. But I might be okay with a cat that's
    very soft and kind\u2026!"
  - I make a lot of mistakes, so I'm worried that a cat would just get annoyed with
    me, heh...
  - "My old cat used to notice EVERYTHING\u2014she was like a guard cat, haha. I
    don't know if I'll ever find another cat like her."
  - I don't want a very flashy cat or anything. Just need a good buddy to spend my
    time with.
  - My cat's gotta be the number one cat in the whole world! I won't accept anything
    less, and they shouldn't, either!
  - I simply adore tiny cats! Have you seen their little paws?
  - Hey, buddy, you got any cats that are BEEFY? You know, like, TOTALLY SWOLE?
